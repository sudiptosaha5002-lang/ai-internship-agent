PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY EXAMPLES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❌ BEFORE (Generic):
   "I am a software Engineer with 2 years of experience in app development."

✅ AFTER (Professional & Impact-Driven):
   "Results-driven Software Engineer with 2+ years of proven expertise in full-stack 
   web application development. Specialized in Python and modern JavaScript frameworks 
   with demonstrated ability to architect scalable systems. Committed to leveraging 
   innovative technologies to solve complex problems and deliver measurable business outcomes."


WORK EXPERIENCE EXAMPLES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❌ BEFORE (Vague, No Impact):
   "I have developed lots of app's backend in my 2 years of working in the company."

✅ AFTER (Specific, Metrics-Driven, Professional):
   - Engineered scalable microservices using Python and Node.js, reducing API response 
     time from 5s to 1.2s (75% improvement) and handling 10K+ concurrent users
   - Architected REST APIs with Django and PostgreSQL, enabling 3 new product features 
     launched ahead of schedule
   - Optimized database queries and implemented Redis caching, improving dashboard 
     performance by 60% and reducing server costs by 40%
   - Led code review initiative and mentored 2 junior developers, improving code quality 
     scores by 35% and reducing production bugs by 50%


KEY IMPROVEMENTS IN VERSION 2.0:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[OK] AGGRESSIVE REWRITING: Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash with HIGH-IMPACT prompts
[OK] POWER VERBS ENFORCED: "Engineered," "Architected," "Delivered," NOT "Worked on"
[OK] METRICS REQUIRED: Every achievement includes %, time reduction, or quantified result
[OK] TECH SPECIFIC: Technology stack integrated into descriptions
[OK] FALLBACK QUALITY: If LLM fails, template-based fallback is still professional
[OK] STRUCTURE: Perfect ATS format with bullet points and power words
[OK] BUSINESS IMPACT: Shows value delivered, not just tasks completed


HOW IT WORKS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. User enters info (can be minimal/generic)
2. Gemini 2.5 Flash AGGRESSIVELY rewrites with:
   - Strong action verbs
   - Quantifiable metrics
   - Business/technical impact
3. If LLM fails, HIGH-QUALITY fallback template is used
4. Result: Professional resume ready for top employers


NEXT STEPS:
